# Relative Trajectory Balance is equivalent to Trust-PCL

This repository is adapted from https://github.com/GFNOrg/diffusion-finetuning with minimal changes. 

## Modification:
- Corrected RL baseline in the rtb_diffusion task to get the performance reported in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01632).

## References:
This code builds upon the public implementation of [Venkatraman et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20971).
